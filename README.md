# Numerical Methods Lab

This project explores numerical approaches to solving ordinary differential equations. It implements and compares:

- **Eulerâ€™s Method**
- **Backward Euler Method**
- **Midpoint Method**

The notebook applies these methods to various differential equations, visualizes the results, and compares them to exact solutions. Residual plots are also used to highlight the accuracy of each method.

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Topics Covered
- Forward and backward numerical integration
- Stability of numerical methods
- Residual analysis for error estimation

## Visualizations
Plots compare the numerical solutions against exact solutions and show residuals for deeper insights.
